What is Tabrec?

Tabrec is a personalized tab actions recommender for Google Chrome. The purpose of Tabrec is to boost the productivity
of users by providing appropriate recommendations based on Your browser usage.

How to install Tabrec?
---
The fastest way is to install Tabrec from [Google Chrome store](http://tabber.fiit.stuba.sk:9292).

Current state
---
At this moment Tabrec is only capable of gathering parallel browsing mechanisms usage.
We focus on events like creating, navigation, closing and moving (rearranging) tabs in one or more windows.
We care strongly about privacy, so we don't collect any personal information about the users.
All URLs are encrypted before they are sent and stored.

Later (Summer 2015) Tabrec release 1.0 is planned to actually provide
tab actions recommendations based on usage patterns we will find using the data (usage logs) we are now collecting.
