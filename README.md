What is TabRec?
---
TabRec is a personalized tab actions recommender for Google Chrome. The purpose of TabRec is to boost the productivity
of users by providing appropriate recommendations based on Your browser usage.

How to install TabRec?
---
The fastest way is to install TabRec from [Google Chrome store](http://tabber.fiit.stuba.sk:9292).

Current state
---
At this moment TabRec is capable of gathering parallel browsing mechanisms usage and
we focus on events like creating, navigation, closing and moving (rearranging) tabs in one or more windows.
We care strongly about privacy, so we don't collect any personal information about the users.
All URLs are encrypted before they are sent and stored.

From version 0.8 TabRec is capable of real-time detection and recommendation. Currently only one pattern
is supported and only semi-interactive recommendation mode is enabled.

Later (May 2015) TabRec release 1.0 is planned to support more patterns and recommendations based on collected
usage patterns as well as support for all three recommendation modes.
